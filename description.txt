WebPageMaker by Kyle Stevenson

My application was designed as a tool to easily create html pages.  I had two types of users in mind: Those who have none or little
html/css knowledge, and those who do know how to create webpages.

WebPageMaker allows a user to create a website by adding their content and choosing desired style options.  The user will fill out a page title,
which will be displayed as the heading of the page as well as the head title in the browser tab.  A subtitle, choose a head banner color and size.

Then can change the whole page background color.  I included a choice of popular colors for websites for the user to select, as well as a field
to enter any css acceptable color (name, hex value, rgb value).  Page font style can then be chosen from a number of options, as well as font size.

The user can add sections to their page, the main body content.  Sections are added dynamically upon clicking "Add Section".  The user
can fill out the section heading, sub heading, and content sections, and optionally make it a 'Hero' section - giving it a full width banner color,
color is chosen by the user.

By clicking File > Clear , the input fields will be cleared and select boxes will be reset to their default index.
By clicking File > Create Webpage , the html file will be generated and a save dialog will appear for the user to save their new html page.
By clicking File > Exit , the application will close.

The html file created is well formatted and commented to aid the user.
The html file created uses the Bulma CSS framework.  Each html page generated by this tool is responsive and mobile friendly.

A user can leave any or all input fields blank to create an empty template html page, this could be very useful for a developer, as it takes only
seconds to create a blank webpage.  The resulting page will be well formatted and include all required tags, including responsive tags and the 
Bulma CDN.
